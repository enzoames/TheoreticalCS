Turing Machine Project
  - Turing Decider to accept all input words of the right type and reject all
    other.
  - Ames_Report.pdf explain the time and space complexity of the machine

Instructions:
  - Open JFLAP_Thin.jar
  - File -> open -> Ames.jff
  - Run the turing machine with any desired inputs
