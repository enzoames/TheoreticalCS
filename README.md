Turing Machine Project
  - Turing Decider to accept all input words of the right type and reject all
    other.
  - Ames_Report.pdf explains the analysis, time and space complexity of the
    turing machine

Deterministic Finite Automaton
  - L = the set of strings over {a, b} in which the substring aa occurs at
    least twice

Push Down Automaton
  - Design a PDA for the language
    L = { a^n b^m | m, n >= 0, m >= 2 * n }

  - Ames_Report2.pdf explains the analysis, time and space complexity of both
    DFA and PDA

Instructions:
  - Download JFLAP_Thin.jar
  - File -> open -> Ames.jff or DeterministicFiniteAutomaton.jff or
    PushDownAutomaton.jff
  - Run the turing machine with any desired inputs
